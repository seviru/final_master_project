# This is the repository where I will regularly upload the advances that I carry out on my practices for the Master of Computational Biology from the Universidad Politecnica de Madrid. The practices are titled "Computational analysis for the identificaction of new diversity with potential functional involvement in a wide catalog of genetic families".
# The idea is that the results achieved with these experiments will allow me to write my final thesis for this course as well.

## INDEX

### - data: Folder that contains all the results from executing the scripts from the different folders.
### - cluster_info_finder: Folder that contains multiple algorithms to extract data from our MongoDB, as well as the information retrieved stored in different files.
### - multiple_aligner: Folder that contains algorithms to carry out multiple alignments from our <fasta>.fas files.
### - tree_builder: Folder that contains algorithms to carry out phylogenetic tree building from our <alignment>.fas.alg files.
### - failure_handler: Folder that contains algorithms to check that our other scripts had a correct functioning, and diverse functionalities such as removing corrupted files or making reports about them.
### - swissprot_parser: Folder that contains algorithms to download a specified swissprot data file, and create a JSON file with the annotations that It contains for each entry.
